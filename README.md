TBD

<!-- My education background is in life science mainly focused on cellular and molecular biology. In my previous positions, I worked on many projects invovled in developing disease model using human stem cell. It is in my last position, where I get chance to work in the industry and collaborate with data scientists and machine learning engineers. That's where I understood the impact of AI on drug discovery. with that curiosity, I took some time off focus on developing those skills in AI hoping working on projects that combine my background and my newly acquried skills in drug discovery. -->
